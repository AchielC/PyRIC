  1) overall
   o look at iw dev wlan0 link
   o look at iw dev
   o have been using iwlist nic channel to get the current channel.
    - this only works on STAs that are associated
    - this uses ioctl
    - Can we use iw to find the current channel? and can we find the current
      channel of a radio in monitor mode that is actively scanning? If not, just
      use the structure returned from info
  2) libnl.py
   o see (1) in RFI
   o define attr_ops and attr_mcast_groups in nla_policy_attr
  4) pyw
   o add txget from iw i.e. netlink perspective
   o devstds sucks, find a better way to find the supported standards of a card
