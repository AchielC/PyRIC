A simple interface to the underlying nl80211 kernel support that handles the
complex operations of netlink seamlessy while maintaining a minimum of "code
walking" to understand, modify and add future operations. Not a full blown port
of iw (and ifconfig, iwconfig) functionality to Python but sufficient to
programmatically create a wireless pentest environment"""
