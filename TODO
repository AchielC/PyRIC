 8) Two commands that would add information of minor value
 o ethtool. uses ioctl but does not follow same pattern as ifconfig seems
    to use
  - ethtool -i <dev> gives driver information including firmware-version
  - ethtool -S <dev> gives some statistics on rx/tx
 and udevadm (does what hardware.py does)
 11) tried NL80211_CMD_GET_WIPHY, setting _WIPHY_TX_POWER_LEVEL but did
  not return the current power level - currently cannot find anything in nl80211.h
  that could be used to get tx power
 17) distro tests
  o openSUSE
  o RedHat/Fedora
  o Debian (g2g)
  o Arch
  o CentOs (?)
  o slackware
  o dd-wrt/OpenWRT
 21) look at NL80211_CMD_START_AP - no need to try and recreate the wheel by
  replicate hostap but could be useful
 22) txset
   o NOTE: the following is consistent with what iw gives us
   o when using dBm
    - get Operation not supported for setting tx power (see pyw.txset)
    - have tried using the ifindex and phy. Both methods are accepted, returning
     only Errno 95.
   o when using mBm
    - no errors reported but tx power is not changed
   o Is the operation not supported by my cards? or is it not supported by the
     kernel?
  26) need to parse dumps NLM_F_DUMP, for now we're good with link etc, so long
   as the card is connected but it may come up eventually
  29) figure out how to parse the information element in pyw.link - there's some
   good shit in it including sometimes the router os and type
  31) add VHT processing to sta_info bitrate
  35) iw connect (on open) returns status of successful connect but card is
   not connected -> move to wpa_supplicant to see how they do it
  36) do we need to write a find nested attribute? so we don't need to go iterate
    a list of attributes to find one
  39) parsing wiphy_bands
   o _HT_MCS_SET: a 16-bit attr containing the MCS set as defined in 802.11n (find this)
   o _HT_CAPA: as in the HT information IE
  42) is there a simple way to set the format strings as constants keeping in
   mind that things like strings require a length in the format string
  45) find out if some the 'flags' for bands are actually supported such as
   HT40+ which should be disabled for channel 11
  46) max-tx for bands is showing 15 when iwconfig shows 30
  47) in link, NL80211_BSS_BEACON_IES vs NL80211_BSS_INFORMATION_ELEMENT
   BEACON_IES may not always be present
