1) add a cli
2) rfkill - unblocks/blocks all devices (as does the cli rfkill) Is this an
  an ubuntu, kernel or overall issue
3) parse NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_BANDS (have workaround currently in place)
 - after figuring out _CIPHER_SUITES, may be able to get a solution for the bands
6) find a better way to get supported standards of a card
8) Two commands that would add information of minor value
 o ethtool. uses ioctl but does not follow same pattern as ifconfig seems
    to use
  - ethtool -i <dev> gives driver information including firmware-version
  - ethtool -S <dev> gives some statistics on rx/tx
 o iw dev wlan0 link returns information related to associated station. It sends
   two commands the first is to initiate a scan, the second is @NL80211_CMD_GET_STATION.
   The return from the kernel is a @NL80211_CMD_NEW_STATION, one of the attributes
   is a @NL80211_ATTR_STA_INFO
  - What is this? Looking at nl80211_h line 1648 we find the definition for
    NL80211_STA_INFO - this has to be the corresponding data. Doesn't work, there
    is something I'm missing but cannot figure out
  - iw requests info on the BSSID, can we request the info on any STA?
  - Line 1806 These attribute types are used with %NL80211_ATTR_STA_INFO
    when getting information about a station.
 11) tried NL80211_CMD_GET_WIPHY, setting _WIPHY_TX_POWER_LEVEL but did
  not return the current power level - currently cannot find anything in nl80211.h
  that could be used to get tx power
 14) look at udevadm info --query=all --path /sys/class/net/<dev>
  o has devie driver, name and some other details but appears to get these
   the same way PyRIC does
 17) distro tests
  - openSUSE
  - RedHat/Fedora
  - Debian (g2g)
  - Arch
  - CentOs (?)
  - slackware
  - dd-wrt/OpenWRT
 18) port structs from new nl80211.h
 19) iw is showing a command that doesn't exist
